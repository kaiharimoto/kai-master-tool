# Neue Master Tool

The deck builder for a desk: mouse, keyboard, a large display, and the
**Master UI** design language (`github.com/kaiharimoto/Master-UI`,
`kit/MASTER-UI.md`) — paper and ink, zero radius, no shadows, Inter, numbered
pages, a quiet voice.

It is a **separate application** from the tablet app and from the older
`:desktopApp`. It installs on its own, keeps its own data, updates itself from
its own release track, and shares only the rules: `:core` (every deck rule,
fitter, lens and odds calculation) and `:ui`'s state holders
(`DeckBuilderState`, whose behaviour is the tablet's by construction). None of
its look comes from `:ui`.

Play mode is not in it. kai will rebuild play from scratch later; Neue is the
builder, its odds and its statistics.

## 1. Where it lives

| | |
|---|---|
| `app/neue/` | the module: UI and `main`, JVM only |
| `app/neue/VERSION` | the version a local build carries; releases pass `-Pneue.versionName` |
| `app/neue/icons/` | installer icons, drawn by `tools/neue/mark.py` |
| `core/input/DeskShortcuts.kt` | the keyboard, as data |
| `core/prefs/NeuePreferences.kt` | its settings document (`"neue.ui"`) |
| `core/update/NeueReleaseTrack.kt` | how it finds its own releases |
| `.github/workflows/release-neue.yml` | the release |
| `studio/.../NeueStudio.kt` | headless screenshots: `tools/shoot.sh --neue` |

```
cd app && ./gradlew :neue:run                  # run it (needs the Android SDK, like :ui)
./gradlew :neue:jvmTest                         # the Master UI law test and the key map
tools/shoot.sh --neue --page=builder --theme=ink --width=2560 --height=1440 --name=b
```

## 2. Master UI, and the two exceptions

`neue/theme/` is `MASTER-UI.md` §2–§7 translated into Compose: `MuColors` is
paper, ink and the ink alpha ramp; Ink is `MuColors.of(ink = true)`, the exact
inversion; `MuType` is the 96/56/32/20/14/12/11 scale in Inter (bundled, OFL)
with JetBrains Mono for numbers; `MuMotion` is one easing and three durations.
`neue/kit/` is the component set — buttons, underline inputs, selects,
segmented controls, tabs, switches, sliders, meters, the hatch, the breathing
square, tooltips, menus, dialogs, drawers, toasts — built on foundation
primitives. **Material is not used**, not restyled: it is not imported.

**`MasterUiLawTest` is the kit's `check.mjs` for Kotlin** and runs in CI: a
radius, a shadow, a gradient, a colour literal, a Material import, weight 600,
a spring or an exclamation mark anywhere in `neue/` fails the build.

kai granted two exceptions, and the law test names the two files they live in:

- **`cards/Foil.kt`** and **`cards/Holo.kt`** — the foil border on a card's
  face. It is kept, as kai asked, and it is content rather than chrome (§17:
  the pixels of a picture keep their colour). See §2a.
- **`cards/GroupMarkers.kt`** — *"colors are allowed for deckbuilding markers
  only (like card groups in the deck itself assigned by the user)"*. A group's
  hue shows in the deck's cracks, on its key, on its mark. Lenses that are
  facts rather than the user's own drawing — type, copies, legality — are told
  apart by ink weight, the way everything else in Master UI is.

Card art keeps its colour inside a §17 content frame. Nothing else does.

### 2a. The holographic foil

kai chose it from six Blender mockups (`tools/foil/`, variant C) and asked for it
to be made better; `Holo.kt` is the refined model, per pixel, as a runtime
shader through `ui/gpu/StageShader`. A foil stamp is a mirror with a
diffraction grating pressed into it:

- **silver** with an anisotropic highlight — a streak that slides round the
  band — under two lights, a key from the upper left and a bounce from the
  lower right;
- **diffraction** from concentric grooves: order *m* shows the wavelength
  `λ = d · |(L + V) · g| / m`, three orders, d = 1600 nm, added as light;
- **grooves** you can see up close, which break the rainbow into striations
  (their pitch never drops below 3 px — finer is moiré);
- a **rim** where the stamp meets the print, lit by the same key, with an ink
  hairline.

**The frame round the artwork is the same stamp.** One set of grooves runs
across the card, so the border and the art frame catch the light together. Where
that frame is depends on the card's template, and `core/layout/ArtFrame.kt`
holds the three, measured to the pixel off YGOPRODeck's renders (813 × 1185):
**standard** for every monster, spell, trap and token frame, a square bevel from
(86, 205) to (728, 846); **pendulum**, wider and reaching down past the scales
because the art runs on behind the pendulum-effect box, from (44, 204) to (769,
887); and **Link**, the standard square with the eight arrow sockets left
unfoiled, because they are printed over it. Skill cards have no frame here.
`ArtFrameTest` pins the shapes; `:studio:shootFoil --cards=id:frameType,...`
draws a row of card types for checking the alignment by eye.

The eye is a couple of card-widths away and the **pointer moves it**: a mouse
stands in for tilting the card, and the light glides there over 180 ms when
the pointer leaves. The card itself never moves. Where runtime shaders are
unavailable the classic two-hue band is drawn instead (DESIGN.md §6).

`tools/shoot.sh`'s studio has a mode for it — `:studio:shootFoil` draws the
real `drawFoil` on real card art at scripted pointer positions, or as a sweep
for a GIF — so the app's foil can be compared frame for frame with the Blender
reference. Settings → Foil offers Holographic (the default), Classic and Off.

## 3. The window

A 40 px title bar (mark, wordmark, update pill, `Search Ctrl K`, status), the
232 px index rail — `01 Decks · 02 Builder · 03 Odds · 04 Stats`, Settings
below the rule — and the page.

**02 Builder** is three columns and a footer. The pool (search, inline
filters, a ruled grid of cards) and the inspector are resizable and hideable;
the deck between them is **fitted, never scrolled**, by the tablet's own
`DeckFitter.plan`: row widths in (10 main, 15 extra and side), one card size
out. On a large display the fitter simply hands back larger cards. The footer
carries the one strong rule, the counts, legality, and the one primary action.

## 4. Mouse and keyboard

| Mouse | |
|---|---|
| hover a card | the inspector shows it |
| click | select (the inspector keeps it; `Delete` acts on it) |
| double-click, pool | add to the main or extra deck |
| Shift double-click, pool | add to the side deck |
| double-click, deck | remove that copy |
| right-click | everything else: move, group, copy name, remove all |
| drag | anywhere, with the tablet's drop rules (`GridDropResolver`, `DeckBuilderState`) |

Presses select immediately and a second press within 350 ms is the
double-click — no `combinedClickable`, which delays every single click.
Dragging starts past the slop, with no hold: a mouse scrolls with its wheel,
so the tablet's 120 ms settle has nothing to disambiguate.

The keyboard is `DeskShortcuts`, one table resolved in one place, rendered by
the help dialog (`F1`) and reachable by name from the palette (`Ctrl K`).
`DeskShortcutsTest` holds every action bound and no chord meaning two things at
once; `DeskKeysTest` holds every key in the table pressable. The pool keys
(`↑ ↓ Enter`, `Shift Enter` for the side) are live *while typing in the search
field* and nowhere else, so confirming a deck name never adds a card.

## 5. Releases, updates and feedback — the permanent numbers

`release-neue.yml`, dispatched with a version, builds a `.msi` (Windows), a
`.dmg` (macOS) and a `.deb` (Linux) and publishes them as
`neue-master-tool-<version>.<ext>` under the tag **`neue-v<version>`**.

- **Every Neue release is a pre-release, and its tag is never `v*`.**
  `/releases/latest`, which every installed APK asks, returns the newest
  non-pre-release of any tag; a Neue release that was not a pre-release would
  hide the next APK from every tablet. The 3DS track learned this first
  (`release-3ds.yml`). Neue lists releases and filters by its prefix
  (`NeueReleaseTrack`), so the flag costs it nothing.
- **`windows.upgradeUuid` is permanent** (`app/neue/build.gradle.kts`). An MSI
  with a different one installs beside the old app rather than over it.
- **The version only goes up**, and is three numbers with major and minor
  under 256 — an MSI constraint. The workflow refuses anything else.
- The MSI is **per-user**, so an update needs no administrator. On Windows the
  app downloads the installer, starts a small script that runs `msiexec
  /passive` and reopens the new build, and quits. On macOS it opens the
  `.dmg`; on Linux it hands the `.deb` to the package installer.
- The installers are **not code-signed**. Windows SmartScreen and macOS
  Gatekeeper will warn once; the release notes say how to get past it.

A crash is written to `<data>/crash.txt` and shown on the next launch in a
window with no theme (so it renders when the theme was what broke), with
`Copy` and `Report →`. **Report an issue** (Settings and the palette) opens a
GitHub issue with the version and the system filled in.

Data lives in `%APPDATA%\NeueMasterTool`, `~/Library/Application
Support/NeueMasterTool` or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/neue-master-tool` — its own SQLite
database (schema version 3, the same migrations), its own card-art cache. Decks
move between Neue and the other builds by `.ydk`/`.ydkx`.

## 6. Shipping a change to Neue

The same discipline as the APK, on its own track: push to the `claude/**`
branch, wait for `build-app.yml` (its `neue` job runs the law test and
packages the `.deb`), fast-forward `main`, dispatch `release-neue.yml` on
`main` with the next patch, and confirm the tag and **all three** installers
are on the release before calling it shipped. A change that touches only
`neue/` does not need an APK release; one that changes `:core` or `:ui`
behaviour does, as always.
